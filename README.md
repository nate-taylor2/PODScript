# Front-end POD Script using Selenium

This program allows you to access OME using front-end html tags to interact with the site and upload PODs

How to install:

<b> 1. Download the repository </b>

    Click on the green Code button and click on Download ZIP. Then, unzip the folder.
  
<b> 2. Install Dependencies </b>


    Ensure you have Python installed.
    (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    To install the dependencies:
      - Search 'Command Prompt' and press enter
          This will open the window where you will be running the code and installing dependencies.
      - Type 'cd C:\Users\name\Downloads\SeleniumPOD-main\SeleniumPOD-main' REPLACE the path with the location of your download. No             quotation marks either.
      - Type and press enter: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
      
<b> 3. Run the Program </b>

    Type and press enter: python main.py
    
Now, a box should pop up where you can enter your username, password, pin, and paste the directory of the folder you would like
to upload PODs for.

Keep in mind that all of the files in the folder MUST be pdf's or else the code will not work. Also, the path needs to be pasted
exactly like how the example is shown in the popup window.

<b> DO NOT move your mouse or press any keys when the script is running, this could cause the driver to not work properly. </b>
